Hey, We have created this Covid-19 Templates with Live Tracker.

Technolgy used:

1) Language: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
2) Library: jQuery, Owlcarsoul, Maginific Popup & Chart.js
3) Framework: Bootstrap 4.5
4) API: Covid-19 (India/Summary).

We are giving these templates for free. You are free to customize this website according to your need.
The purpose of giving the source code to learn the basic thing how can you create a beautiful website using these technologies and how you have to manage the file/folder structure for static websites. In the source code, I have mentioned the comments when needed so that you can understand the better code.

Study that code and create a website like this and make sure that it should be responsive.

Hope after studying the code you will create a new simple project.

If you ask me which project should you create then my suggestion is to create a weather forecasting website using API so that anyone can see live updates of whether in the particular area.

And if you really create any project then please send it to me for review. So that I can share your work on my page.
